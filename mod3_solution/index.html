             Are the lowest level of ninja and also the ones that display the most difference in power. When they become genin, ninja start to do their bit for their village's economy – being sent on missions that the village gets paid for. They are typically sent either on D-rank missions, which are almost entirely risk-free jobs of manual labour, or, rarely, on C-rank missions, which are a cut above that and begin to verge on real "ninja" work that have a very low possibility of risk to the ninja involved. When Konohagakure was short-handed on upper-level ninja because of the invasion, the village had to occasionally send genin on higher-ranked missions.
             Genin are put in four-man cells or squad, consisting of three genin and a jōnin-sensei, in order to learn teamwork and experience true ninja life under the supervision and protection of an elite shinobi. The make-up of these teams is based on the individual skills of the genin, so that there will be a balance between the teams. For instance, Naruto Uzumaki, who passed with the lowest grades, was put in a team with Sasuke Uchiha and Sakura Haruno, who passed with the highest grades and highest written exam scores, respectively. The teams are usually made up of two boys and one girl.

              <h3 class="text-center">Chunin</h3>
              Are ninja who have reached a level of maturity and ability that primarily consists of leadership skills and tactical prowess. Chūnin are typically sent on C-rank or B-rank missions. Some chūnin, such as Iruka Umino and Shino Aburame, move on to become Academy teachers.
              To become a chūnin, genin participate in a large examination, known as the Chūnin Exams. Those who pass the test and become chūnin are eligible to wear an identifying flak jacket that holds ninjutsu scrolls. This vest is not mandatory.
              As a result of the peaceful era that the Five Great Shinobi Countries established after the Fourth Shinobi World War, the number of chūnin has decreased.[1]

              Are generally highly experienced and highly skilled shinobi who serve as military captains. Jōnin are generally able to use at least two types of elemental chakra.[1] It is not unusual for jōnin to go on missions alone. They are often sent on A-rank missions, and if experienced enough, S-rank missions as well (which are considered to be the greatest difficulty). To become a jōnin, one may be recommended. If enough villagers and the respective Kage deem the shinobi to be fitting to the rank, they will be promoted.[2][3] In the anime, another way to become a jōnin is to participate in the Jōnin Exam.[4]  When a ninja becomes a jōnin, they may be assigned to supervise a three-man genin team. Their duty will be to instruct and train them to become competent ninja. They also can decide when the genin are ready to participate in the Chūnin Exams.  In Konohagakure, it is up to the jōnin to decide whether a candidate Hokage would be given the position permanently. They also have a special rank known as Jōnin Commander. Shinobi who have jōnin-level skills in only a specialised area are classified as Tokubetsu Jōnin.
